# It's Not _Jaws_

...is a party game based around guessing a movie based on clues. It's a little like Wordle for movies.

### How to play

One person thinks of a movie.

It should be a movie they expect everyone else playing has seen, or at least heard enough of to be able to guess. You don't win by thinking of the most obscure movie, you get booed for that.

The rest of the players try to guess what movie the person is thinking of, just by naming movie titles.

Someone might say, "is it _Back to the Future_?"

...to which the person might respond, "it's not _Back to the Future_, but it _is_ part of a trilogy" (maybe it's _Lord of the Rings_?)

Or, "it's not _Back to the Future_, but it _does_ feature a flying vehicle" (maybe it's _Snakes on a Plane_?)

Or, "it's not _Back to the Future_, but it _does_ have an actor playing multiple parts" (maybe it's _The Nutty Professor_?)

The guessers use this information to zero in on the movie until they guess it.

When the movie is revealed, if the guessers think it's too obscure, they may boo.

The person who guesses the movie picks the next movie, and the game continues.

The goal of the game is not to trick people, or be a pedant, or show off your obscure movie trivia, or to give as little useful information as possible. The goal of the game is to have fun!

If the group is large you can have two people be responsible for giving clues. Sometimes it gets hard to give good clues.

Oh, and the movie can't be _Jaws_.
